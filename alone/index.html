          Culturally, mentally or emotionally, we all can feel alienated from others around us, being alone not in the
          physical sense, but alone in our own headspace. It's the feeling of being absolutely isolated in your mind,
          being unable to reach out to anyone near you because they simply cannot relate to your own experiences and thoughts.

                      The first song released off of their 2016 third studio album <i>Home of the Strange</i>. "Amerika" speaks about the modern generation's

                      of the romanticized cultures of our forefathers." First-generation and second-generation immigrants feel this struggle of finding
                      who you are and what you believe besides our clashing cultures of our foreign-born parents and idealized Americans.

                  potential for universal love, or the "love there that's sleeping", among all people of the world, taking on a much more alienated and observatorial
                  look on the world.

                  people at his then-age of 22 years old. The song explores themes that almost border on regret and apathy towards his growing rap career.

                      "Nikki" was not a person, but rather was a personification for his overwhelming nicotine addiction. Logic explores his need for
                      Nikki and his inability to enjoy himself or enjoy life without Nikki, becoming a slave for her.

                  and his inability to continue their long distance relationship due to Josh's touring and burgeoning rap career.

          "Regret is such a short word... and yet it stretches on forever." -Ranata Suzuki. People like to reminisce about what
          could've been done, why didn't they do this or that, or what could've happened. However, as much as we try to relate to
          one another in the past, there is no true way for one to relate to the miniscule differences of our lives that makes
          us who we are. In this, we are truly alone.

                      One of the most emotional, regret-filled songs of NF's latest album release "The Search", the song "I Miss The Days" touches upon
                      his early childhood and innocence free of his demons and trauma. NF talks about his transition from a child free of worried about
                      being unappreciated, being unloved, and making a living, to a man who struggles with these worries everyday. "I Miss The Days"
                      perfectly encapsulates that feeling of regretting or reminsicing about your childhood, about why would you worry about insignificant
                      choices, and about why did you not cherish those innocent days more dearly.

                  The first single from Matchbox Twenty's frontman Rob Thomas, "Lonely No More" is about the narrator struggling with his previous

                  lover. The song encapsulates the emotions of someone that's so regretful and frustrated with his romantic streak, much to the ignorance
                  of others that are partying and enjoying life around him.

                  Coming off of their debut album as the lead single, "Over My Head (Cable Car)" by the Fray discusses the last few moments of a
                  relationship that's about to end. The narrator even tries to rearrange events at one point in the song to have the best outcome,
                  yet does so without much success. The song discusses broken friendships and relationships as the narrator finds that time is
                  inevitably running out on him. Although inspired by the conflict and later mended relationship between lead singer Isaac Slade
                  and his brother, the song takes on themes more focused towards friendships and romance.

                  The most covered song in history, "Yesterday" by the Beatles has a narrator regretfully lamenting about what went wrong in his
                  broken romantic relationship, with him "longing for yesterday." The narrator remarks about his sadness and anguish, with having
                  a "shadow hanging over" him and needing "a place to hide away." The song iconically captures the emotion of regret and sorrow over
                  a past relationship. Featuring only a guitar and string quartet, "Yesterday" was voted the best song of the 20th century by BBC
                  music experts and also given the title of the number 1 pop song of all time by MTV and Rolling Stone in 1999.

                    <p class="card-text font-light">
                      Released in 2004 by American rock band Eels and famously featured in the movie <i>Shrek 2</i>, "I Need Some Sleep" takes
                      on a much more dark and depressing theme than it initially lets on. Lead singer/songwriter Mark Oliver Everett, otherwise known
                      as "E", has faced death all his life: his father died of a heart attack with E finding him when E was 19; his sister
                      Elizabeth committed suicide when E was 33; his mother died two years later of lung cancer; and his cousin perished on the plane
                      that hit the Pentagon in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. These tragedies have served as a long-running inspiration for E's work, with "I Need
                      Some Sleep" having its narrator seeking peace from the turbulence of life. The song touches upon the possibility of the narrator committing suicide as a way out,
                      with the line, "I need some sleep / Time to put the old horse down".

                <p class="card-text font-light">
                  Althought it could be easily misconstrued as an unimpressive song about sex and bragging, "Medium" by Jakey has a much
                  more dark meaning behind it. The chorus repeats with "That's my shit", "Fuckin' a bitch", "Fuckin' your bitch", but Jakey
                  explains how he chose intentionally boorish lyrics to mask the "sad truth of the mindset" he was in during high school--Jakey
                  got drunk one year, lost his virginity to his friend's girlfriend, who committed suicide years later. Jakey also explains that
                  the song is titled "Medium" as a double meaning: he wore medium shirts in high school, but now wears large shirts, and the
                  word "medium" is defined as someone who can communicate with the dead. The song aims to capture Jakey's mindset and thoughts he
                  had in high school, with mostly trivial matters being the content of the song with him touching upon his friend's girlfriend's suicide.

                  "How Could You Leave Us" is the fourth song on NF's sophomore album <i>Therapy Session</i>, and NF claims that it has been the
                  hardest song for him to write and record to-date and a song that he also regrets ever making. The song tackles on his mother's
                  overdose on pills in 2009, with NF bawling and crying out about his mother's sudden departure from his life, leaving him with
                  his two sisters. NF discusses his troubling childhood with child services, his mother's boyfriend's physical abuse, and pure
                  anger and frustration at how things turned out for him. The song ends with NF talking into the microphone and crying about his
                  mother's passing.

                  The fifth track on their third studio album <i>Minutes to Midnight</i>, "Shadow of the Day"
                  by Linkin Park is about someone who is about to die. The song takes on the perspective of an
                  observer or even Death itself, as the narrator soothes the subject as death approaches. The
                  subject's friends are scared to let go of the subject, but the narrator encourages the subject
                  to finally let go and succumb to death.
