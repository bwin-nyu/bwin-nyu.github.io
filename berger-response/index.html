  <h2>My Reflection on John Berger's <i>Ways of Seeing</i></h2>
  <div class="center-justify-text">
    <p>
      John Berger's <i>Ways of Seeing</i> was an interesting series to watch.
      I would say that the best part of the series was how Berger reconceptualized
      certain parts of art history and culture that I had studied in the past.
      One such example was where he discussed nudity in art.
      In junior high and high school, textbooks had described the study of the nude in art
      as something that paved the way for more of an experimental and liberating culture in Renaissance Europe.
      One moment that stuck out was when Berger discussed how women are portrayed in a "passive" figure that makes
      them the subject of the "spectator" and other men in the painting. I feel like that
      was a really enlightening moment for me to realize how I never saw sexism present
      in nudity in art, and taught me that I should reconsider how I view other topics or cultures.

      Another interesting point was when he was describing how the camera can frame a painting in a very different way
      from how it's supposed to be view. He demonstrated different ways of showing the same painting of Jesus'
      crucifixion but by showing different parts of the painting itself. It certainly demonstrated his point, but it
      did make me think about how John Berger shows different things or objects to frame his own argument to prove his point.
      Just an interesting thought.
